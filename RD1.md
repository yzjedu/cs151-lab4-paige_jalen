This lab, I felt, was a step up in difficulty compared to the previous labs. We had to make a program that gives the
user their monthly bill depending on what package they had. At first the problem looked easy until we started writing 
the algorithm and realized there were more steps needed then we thought. This was the first time implementing a while 
loop and other challenges like converting inputs to lowercase. We took a long time on the algorithm making sure it had 
all the steps needed and then when we went to coding it was relatively easy. There were some minor problems that we had
to fix, but we were able to get the code working. We used the test cases to check the code to make sure the same numbers
were being output. This lab was helpful in practicing concepts we learned in class and using them to make the program 
efficient and easy to use.
